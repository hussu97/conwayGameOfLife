***
A game built using the Java Swing library, based on the logic from [Conway's Game of Life](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/).

The application uses 2D Graphics to manipulate the cells in the game, to update the position of the colored cells (*alive*) and the grey cells (*dead*) at each iteration (*generation*) every second. The application also follows the **Model, View, Controller** pattern, a popular software design architecture.
